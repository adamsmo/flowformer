# Flowformer

A free daily task timer and focus app to assist you in getting one thing done (or not done) each day.

Flowformer lets you enter a single task as a short sentence that you agree to complete (or avoid) over a 24 hour period.

The timer begins and everything in Flowformer is locked down and there's no backing out. You will have 24 hours to succeed or fail.

Every time you visit Flowformer over the 24 hour time slot your task will be displayed as a fullscreen reminder.

Best of luck, you're gonna love the simplicity of discipline.
